## [0.0.36] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `/.github/workflows/lint.yml` to run lint on `push` and `pull_request`
  - `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `lint + test + build`
- Husky pre-commit hook in `/.husky/pre-commit` to run `npm run lint`
- Automated testing stack with Vitest + Testing Library
- Initial test suite for:
  - API layer (`APIClient`, `BaseClient`, request utilities)
  - Providers (`AuthProvider`, `ConfigProvider`, `ManagerProvider`)
  - Utilities (`date`, `local`, `os`)

### Changed

- Migrated ESLint configuration to ESLint v9 flat config (`/eslint.config.js`)
- Removed legacy ESLint files (`/.eslintrc`, `/.eslintignore`)
- Updated Vite config to include Vitest test settings (`/vite.config.ts`)
- Updated documentation in `/README.md`:
  - new test scripts (`test`, `test:watch`)
  - CI status and validation flow
- Updated package metadata and dependencies for the testing/CI setup

### Fixed

- Fixed extensible auth header behavior in `APIClient`:
  - custom `tokenAcquirer` is now assigned in constructor
  - all secured requests now use `this.tokenAcquirer()` instead of hardcoded default acquirer
- Fixed runtime safety in provider contexts:
  - `ManagerProvider` and `AuthProvider` now use `createContext<T | undefined>(undefined)`
  - hooks now reliably throw when used outside provider boundaries
- Fixed several lint/runtime issues discovered during ESLint v9 migration
  - hook dependency issues
  - unused imports/helpers
  - minor consistency fixes across providers and components
